<MarketingBrief>
Unilever Marketing Campaign Brief
Brand: Vaseline
Campaign O bjective:
Position Vaseline as the essential foundation of a simplified self-care ritual that makes women feel they're nurturing their skin's health, not just its appearance.
Target Audience:
Professional women, 35-50, who practice mindfulness, are overwhelmed by complex skincare
routines, and seek to simplify their wellness practices while maintaining effectiveness. They've
purchased at least one wellness subscription in the past year and value products with proven efficacy over trendy ingredients.
Key Message:
"Your skin deserves healing, not just treatment."
Campaign Timing:
Fall launch when skin becomes more sensitive to seasonal changes.
Additional Notes:
Our target feels skeptical about the ever-increasing number of steps in recommended skincare
routines. They seek a return to fundamentals that deliver real results. This campaign will position
Vaseline as the foundational skincare essential that wellness-focused women can trust to truly heal their skin rather than temporarily mask issues.
